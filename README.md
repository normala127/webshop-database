# WebShop Database Design and SQL Implementation

## Project Overview
This project presents the design and SQL implementation of a **relational database for an online WebShop system**.  
It focuses on proper database modeling, normalization, and practical SQL usage for common e-commerce operations.

The project was completed as part of an academic database course and demonstrates foundational backend and data engineering skills.

---

## Database Description
The WebShop database is designed to support:
- User accounts and roles (customers, administrators)
- Products and categories
- Orders and order details
- Payments and transaction tracking

The schema follows relational database best practices, including:
- Clear entity relationships
- Referential integrity
- Normalization up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

---

## Key Concepts Covered
- Relational database design
- Primary and foreign keys
- Constraints for data integrity
- SQL views for simplified querying
- Stored procedures for reusable logic
- Role-based access and permissions
- Sample analytical and transactional queries

---

## Repository Contents
- **WebShop_Database_Report.pdf**  
  Detailed documentation of the database design, including entity descriptions, relationships, and design rationale.

- **sql_samples.pdf**  
  A collection of SQL statements demonstrating:
  - Table creation
  - Sample queries
  - Views
  - Stored procedures
  - Access control examples

---

## Technologies
- SQL (MySQL-style syntax)
- Relational Database Design Principles

---

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in:
- Designing scalable relational schemas
- Translating business requirements into database structures
- Writing structured and maintainable SQL
- Applying normalization and integrity constraints in practice
